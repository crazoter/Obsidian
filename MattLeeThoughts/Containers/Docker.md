- Containers isolate the code; easier to modify and update the program.
- Use shared OS, more efficient than hypervisors
- Easy for cloud deployment
Specifically, for CI/CD Docker makes it possible to [set up local development environments that are exactly like a live server](http://opensource.com/business/14/7/docker-through-hype); run multiple development environments from the same host with unique software, operating systems, and configurations; test projects on new or different servers; and allow anyone to work on the same project with the exact same settings, regardless of the local host environment. This enables developers to run the test suites, which are vital to CI/CD, to quickly see if a newly made change works properly.
