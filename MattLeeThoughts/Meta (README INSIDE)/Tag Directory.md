#meta
Descript
 ===
- The tag directory is centralized document to contain all possible tags.
- This is to facilitate ease of connecting notes together using graph view.
- Add tags to the tag directory first, before making using the tags in your notes.

Using Graph View
 ===
- Open the `filters` tab and select tags.
- Type `-#meta` into the filter search bar to remove all documents tagged as #meta (e.g. this document).

Tag Etiquette
 ===
- Each note should have at least 1 tag.
- Tags should have a self-explanatory name.
- Tags should be sufficiently short.
- Tags should be in camelCase.
- Some notes may be about topics that are more specific. It is recommended to include multiple tags if possible.
- If opting to refactor a tag, please do so for all affected notes.
