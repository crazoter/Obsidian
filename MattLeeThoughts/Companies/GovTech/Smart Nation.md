Smart nation satisfaction
=== 
The Government's move to ramp up its digital services and infrastructure comes as satisfaction with government digital services among Singaporeans remains high, according to GovTech's Government to Citizens survey.

It showed that 85 per cent of citizens were very or extremely satisfied with them last year, similar to 2019's 86 per cent.

The latest survey was done between December last year and this February with about 1,500 people in face-to-face interviews.

Many Singaporeans were also satisfied with services introduced during the pandemic, with 97 per cent saying the Covid-19 digital solutions were delivered in a timely manner.

These services include the MaskGoWhere website that helps people find where and when they can collect their allocated masks, and the SafeEntry contact tracing check-in system.

The poll also found that 98 per cent of citizens said the digital solutions played a key role in fighting Covid-19.
