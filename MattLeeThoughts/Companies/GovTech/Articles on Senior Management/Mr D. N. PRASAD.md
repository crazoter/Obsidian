ex Director of Google people Services

My name is DN Prasad and I'm with Google
As a director of Google people services
For a bike it's a pleasure to be in
Devon and thanks for having me over what
We were focusing on was you know really
The fundamental values that we have as
An organization in Google irrespective
Whether it is a digital transformation
Or any kind of transformation so what
Makes Google Google was the message the
Fact that people are on the front and
Center of everything that we do and they
Form the nucleus of everything that we
Do in Google and how is that you don't
Necessarily need to be Google to be able
To practice some of these things it's
Just about your belief it's the value
That you can bring in it's a choice that
You make so that was the message that we
Were sharing with the audience so
Moonshots is something that we use at
Google for anything that's hugely
Transformational or huge innovations are
Just 10x transformation that we look for
It's something that our CEO of alphabet
LED former CEO of Google Larry you know
I had phrased I had coined essentially
What it means is about you know there is
Incremental transformation that we do an
Incremental innovation which could be
Small changes to anything that we do it
Could be a process it could be a
Practice and that could be in the range
Of about a few percentage points and
That's not going to change significantly
Or move the needle significantly so the
Entire premise here is to be able to
Think 10x and think really large for the
Big changes to happen for the needle to
Move significantly and for game-changing
Innovations to take place googliness is
It's a very googled phrase as you call
Say it's it's a phrase that we use to
Define the values and culture of our
Group so there are very different ways
Of looking at googliness so you know
When we say a person is googley or
Otherwise and we need people to be
Googly it's a combination of a few
Things so let me share a few examples
It's really about whether one can work
Comfortably in a very ambiguous
Situation of fast
Situation when someone can work well in
Teams someone can be a good idea to as
Well as an executor so it's a
Combination of both ideation and
Execution someone who really can roll up
Sleeves and work alongside the teams
Someone who takes their work seriously
But not themselves seriously they have
Passion both at work and outside so it's
Not a uni-dimensional life that they
Lead which is just one passion or one
Work it's really about everything coming
To they're someone who can communicate
Well someone who can really think they
Can lead or be led depending on what
Situation is but in summary you know
Like I mentioned inside as well for me
Doggedness is really about whether
You're doing the right thing when no one
Is noticing you but no one has seen you
That to me is the essence of googliness
The fact that we really care for it and
We're very deliberate and thoughtful
About nurturing the culture and
Strengthening the culture and that was
Read that that's a reason why despite
The significant growth that we've seen
Globally both in terms of scale
Complexity and just our global footprint
Culture remains to be the front and
Center of everything that we do and then
We have a culture that we are all
Incredibly proud of
