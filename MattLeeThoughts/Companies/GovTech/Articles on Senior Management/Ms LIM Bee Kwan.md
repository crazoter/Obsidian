**Helping to secure Singapore's digital future**

**Lim Bee Kwan, Assistant Chief Executive for Governance and Cybersecurity, Government Technology Agency (GovTech)**

LIM Bee Kwan has been keen on a career in technology ever since she was a student. While an undergraduate in the Business Administration faculty at the National University of Singapore, she applied for and was offered a job as a programmer-analyst at National Computer Systems (NCS), then a subsidiary of the National Computer Board (NCB).

The opportunity to help improve the lives of Singaporeans convinced her to stay on in the public sector. She moved to NCB when NCS was corporatised, and was later transferred to the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) when NCB merged with the Telecommunications Authority of Singapore.

At IDA, Ms Lim was involved in the development and rollout of e-services for the People's Association as well as the MediNet infrastructure and systems for the Ministry of Health and its healthcare institutions. She was also responsible for the technology function as part of the Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee.

Today, she works at GovTech - the agency tasked with harnessing info-communications technology for public sector transformation - where she helps to shape Singapore's digital future by developing and implementing initiatives that aim to strengthen cybersecurity and governance across government agencies.

_How does your work at GovTech impact the lives of Singaporeans?_

As Singapore drives transformation across the economy, government and society, cybersecurity and governance are key enablers that will help safeguard the systems and networks as we enrich the lives of citizens through new and better government digital services and programmes such as the National Digital Identity.

The Governance and Cybersecurity groups in GovTech develop strategies and implement programmes that deepen cybersecurity capabilities and strengthen the governance function across government agencies.

_Why do you think it is important for Singapore to realise its Smart Nation vision?_

We are living in the midst of a digital transformation where digital technologies and their accelerating impact across society changes businesses and organisations. To prosper and stay relevant in the world, Singapore has to fully embrace digitalisation, just like how we embraced globalisation and industrialisation in the past.

Smart Nation is about how we make lives better, and how we can work together to use technology more effectively.

_What do you think are the technologies that will have the most impact on Singapore?_

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning will have a profound impact on our society. Already, we see a deluge of products and services such as Alexa that assist us in our homes and daily lives. As machine learning algorithms become smarter, every industry will be disrupted. Our society will transform as skills are augmented by AI, and jobs as we know it will change.

_How did your interest in technology begin?_

I have always been interested in science and technology and how things work. However, science and technology are only useful if they can be deployed and implemented to meet the people's needs and improve lives.

_What are some of the challenges you have faced in your career and how have you overcome them?_

I have had the opportunity to move across diverse portfolios, from application development to infrastructure implementation, industry development and now cybersecurity and governance.

You don't always get to pick what you do and sometimes you have to rise to the call of duty. It is always incumbent on you to find the value and significance in whatever you do, set your ambitions high and have the tenacity and drive to deliver your utmost best.

_What have been some of your more memorable achievements so far?_

I spent a better part of my career developing, implementing and operating large infrastructure systems for the government. Some of these are complex with multiple stakeholders, and are multiyear projects that require careful planning and execution.

The more memorable ones I had the privilege to be involved in are the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games and the Government Infrastructure and Services used by all public service officers.

_What else do you hope to achieve in your career?_

I took on my current cybersecurity and governance portfolios in May this year. These are key enablers, and to do well in them means collaborating better and partnering well with the teams that develop and implement systems so that we facilitate rather than hinder innovations.

_How would you describe your leadership style?_

I had the honour of working with very dedicated and capable teams that have seen through difficult and complex projects. To me, a leader must lead from the front and be with the troops through thick and thin. One must be appreciative of the efforts of the team because you cannot succeed without their help.
